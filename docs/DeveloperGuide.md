### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/spendnsplit/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel` etc. Some parts are made up of even smaller parts. All of these parts, including the `MainWindow`, are subclasses of the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI. 

Some parts (`PersonListPanel`, `TransactionListPanel`, `PersonCard`, `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `HelpWindow`) inherit from `UiPartFocusable` (a subclass of `UiPart`) which enables the to be focused on. This is used for the keyboard navigation feature as `MainWindow` keeps track of the currently focused part and can switch focus to another part when certain keyboard shortcuts are pressed.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/spendnsplit/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Transaction` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and all `Transaction` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTransactionList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` and `Transaction` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as separate _filtered_ lists which are exposed to outsiders as unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Transaction>` lists that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to these lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Keyboard Navigation Feature

#### Overview

The keyboard navigation feature allows users to navigate between different UI components using predefined keyboard shortcuts. This feature enhances fast-typing users' experience by allowing them to navigate the UI without having to use the mouse.

#### Implementation

The implementation of this feature is centered in the `MainWindow` class, which acts as the primary UI container for the application. Within `MainWindow`, two key methods are used: [`setKeyNavigation`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/spendnsplit/ui/MainWindow.java#L148) and [`setKeyNavigations`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/spendnsplit/ui/MainWindow.java#L115). The `setKeyNavigations` utilizes `setKeyNavigation` to assign specific keyboard events to different UI parts.

The [`focusedUiPart`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/spendnsplit/ui/MainWindow.java#L34) field in `MainWindow` keeps track of the currently focused UI part. When the user presses a key combination that matches the one assigned to a UI part, the currently focused UI part (if existed) will be unfocused and then assigned to the newly focused UI part. The newly focused UI part will then be focused.

### Person-related Features

![Overview of Person Class](images/PersonClassDiagram.png)

The `Person` class is the main class in the `seedu.addressbook.person` package. It represents a person in the application and is composed of the following classes:

* `Name`: The name of the person. It must be unique and cannot be null.
* `Phone`: The phone number of the person.
* `Email`: The email address of the person.
* `Address`: The address of the person.
* `TelegramHandle`: The telegram handle of the person.
* `Tags`: The tags associated with the person.

All `Person` objects are stored in `UniquePersonList` in `Model`.

#### Adding a Person

The `addPerson` command creates a new `Person` object with the details provided by the user.

The activity diagram below shows an overview of the `addPerson` command:

![Overview of the `addPerson` Command](images/AddPersonActivityDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram below shows the interactions within the `Logic` component when user runs the `addPerson` command:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `addPerson` Command](images/AddPersonSequenceDiagram.png)

The overall flow of the `addPerson` command is as follows:

1. The user specifies the details of the person to be added. Note that name is the only mandatory field.
2. The parsers check for the presence of the mandatory name field as well as the validity of all provided fields. Errors are raised if any of the fields are invalid.
3. Upon successful parsing, the `AddPersonCommand` is created with the person object to be added to the model.
4. The `AddPersonCommand` is executed by the `LogicManager`, which attempts to add the person to the model through `Model::addPerson(newPerson)`. Errors are raised if the person already exists in the model (duplicate name).
5. Upon successful execution, a `CommandResult` object is returned which contains the success message to be displayed to the user.

#### Editing a Person

The `editPerson` command edits an existing `Person` object with the details provided by the user.

The activity diagram below shows an overview of the `editPerson` command:

![Overview of the `editPerson` Command](images/EditPersonActivityDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram below shows the interactions within the `Logic` component when user runs the `editPerson` command:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `editPerson` Command](images/EditPersonSequenceDiagram.png)

Since the `editPerson` command might affect the `Transaction` objects stored in the model, the sequence diagram below extends the previous sequence diagram to show the interactions within the `Model` component:

![Interactions Inside the Model Component for the `editPerson` Command](images/EditPersonSequenceDiagram2.png)

Key points to note:

- `UniquePersonList::setPerson` updates the `Person` object in the list.
- `UniqueTransactionList::setPerson` changes the `Name` fields of all `Transaction` objects in the list that involve the person to be edited to the new name.
- `SpendNSplit::syncNames` ensures the consistency of the casing of all `Name` fields in the model after the command.
- `SpendNSplit::sortPersons` ensures the consistency of the ordering of all `Person` objects in the model after the command.

The overall flow of the `editPerson` command is as follows:

1. The user specifies the index of the person to be edited and the details to be edited.
2. The parsers check for the presence of the mandatory index field as well as the validity of all provided fields. Errors are raised if any of the fields are invalid.
3. Upon successful parsing, the `EditPersonCommand` is created with the index of the person to be edited and the details to be edited expressed as an `PersonDescriptor` object.
4. The `EditPersonCommand` is executed by the `LogicManager`, which attempts to edit the person in the model through `Model::setPerson(personToEdit, editedPerson)`. Errors are raised if the index exceeds the number of persons currently displayed in `Model::getFilteredPersonList()` or if the edited person already exists in the model (duplicate name).
5. Upon successful execution, a `CommandResult` object is returned which contains the success message to be displayed to the user. 
6. Note that the displayed list of persons will be updated to show all persons in the model after the edit through `Model::updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS)`.

#### Deleting a Person

The `deletePerson` command deletes an existing `Person` object.

The activity diagram below shows an overview of the `deletePerson` command:

![Overview of the `deletePerson` Command](images/DeletePersonActivityDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram below shows the interactions within the `Logic` component when user runs the `deletePerson` command:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletePerson` Command](images/DeletePersonSequenceDiagram.png)

Since the `deletePerson` command might affect the `Transaction` objects stored in the model, the sequence diagram below extends the previous sequence diagram to show the interactions within the `Model` component:

![Interactions Inside the Model Component for the `deletePerson` Command](images/DeletePersonSequenceDiagram2.png)

Key points to note:

- `UniquePersonList::remove` removes the `Person` object from the list.
- `UniqueTransactionList::deletePerson` updates the `Name` fields of all `Transaction` objects in the list that involve the person to be deleted to `Name.OTHERS`. If the updated `Transaction` object is not valid (not involving any other known person), it is removed from the list.
- `SpendNSplit::sortPersons` ensures the consistency of the ordering of all `Person` objects in the model after the command.

The overall flow of the `deletePerson` command is as follows:

1. The user specifies the index of the person to be deleted.
2. The parsers check for the presence of the mandatory index field. Errors are raised if the index is invalid.
3. Upon successful parsing, the `DeletePersonCommand` is created with the index of the person to be deleted.
4. The `DeletePersonCommand` is executed by the `LogicManager`, which attempts to delete the person from the model through `Model::deletePerson(personToDelete)`. Errors are raised if the index exceeds the number of persons currently displayed in `Model::getFilteredPersonList()`.
5. Upon successful execution, a `CommandResult` object is returned which contains the success message to be displayed to the user.

#### Listing Persons

The `listPerson` command lists existing `Person` objects with names matching the keywords provided by the user. If no keywords are provided, all `Person` objects are listed.

The activity diagram below shows an overview of the `listPerson` command:

![Overview of the `listPerson` Command](images/ListPersonActivityDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram below shows the interactions within the `Logic` component when user runs the `listPerson` command:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `listPerson` Command](images/ListPersonSequenceDiagram.png)

The overall flow of the `listPerson` command is as follows:

1. The user specifies the keywords to be matched.
2. The parsers check for the validity of the provided keywords. Errors are raised if the keywords are invalid.
3. Upon successful parsing, the `ListPersonCommand` is created with the keywords to be matched expressed as a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object which implements the `Predicate<Person>` interface.
4. The `ListPersonCommand` is executed by the `LogicManager`, which attempts to update the displayed list of persons through `Model::updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)`.
5. Upon successful execution, a `CommandResult` object is returned which contains the success message to be displayed to the user.

#### Sorting Persons

The `sortPerson` command sorts displayed `Person` objects by the specified order.

The activity diagram below shows an overview of the `sortPerson` command:

![Overview of the `sortPerson` Command](images/SortPersonActivityDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram below shows the interactions within the `Logic` component when user runs the `sortPerson` command:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `sortPerson` Command](images/SortPersonSequenceDiagram.png)

The overall flow of the `sortPerson` command is as follows:

1. The user specifies the order to be sorted by. It is the only mandatory field and must be `+` (ascending) or `-` (descending).
2. The parsers check for the validity of the provided order. Errors are raised if the order is invalid.
3. Upon successful parsing, the `SortPersonCommand` is created with the order to be sorted by expressed as a boolean value.
4. The `SortPersonCommand` is executed by the `LogicManager`, which attempts to update the displayed list of persons through `Model::sortPersonAscending()` or `Model::sortPersonDescending()`.
5. Upon successful execution, a `CommandResult` object is returned which contains the success message to be displayed to the user.

### Transaction-related Features

#### Adding Transactions

##### Settling Balances

#### Editing Transactions

Editing transactions mechanism is facilitated by `EditTransactionCommand`. It extends `Command` with the ability to edit a transaction.

It consists of the following classes:

* `EditTransactionCommand`â€” Represents a command to edit a transaction.
* `EditTransactionCommandParser`â€” Parses user input into a `EditTransactionCommand`.
* `EditTransactionDescriptor`â€” Stores the details to edit the transaction with. Each non-empty field value will replace the corresponding field value of the transaction.

<img src="images/EditTransactionCommandDiagram.png" width="550" />

**Note**: The above class diagram is to be updated to reflect the new implementation, with the addition of `UpdateExpenseCommand`.

Upon execution, `EditTransactionCommand` will retrieve the transaction to be edited from `filteredTransactionList` from `Model`, create a copy of the `Transaction` object with the new details, then replace the old `Transaction` object with the new one in `filteredTransactionList`.

We chose this method of execution instead of directly editing the `Transaction` object in `filteredTransactionList` because `Model` re-renders the UI only when `filteredTransactionList` is updated. If we were to edit the `Transaction` object directly, `Model` would not be able to detect the change and re-render the UI.

##### Updating Portions

#### Deleting Transactions

#### Duplicating Transactions

#### Filtering Transactions

### Other Features

#### Setting Shorthands

##### Overview

The `setShorthand` command allows users to set a shorthand, or alias for an existing command. This shorthand can then be used in place of the command.

The activity diagram is as follows:

<img src="images/SetShorthandCommandActivityDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component and `Model` component:

<img src="images/SetShorthandCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="550"/>

<img src="images/SetShorthandCommandSequenceDiagram2.png" width="550"/>

##### Feature Details

1. The user specifies the original command and the new shorthand in the `setShorthand` command.
2. If the original command is invalid or does not exist, the user will be informed of the error.
3. If the shorthand is already an existing original command, the user will be informed of the error.
4. If the shorthand is already being used as a shorthand for another command, the user will be informed of the error.
5. If the original command has an existing shorthand, the new shorthand will replace the existing shorthand.

##### Implementation Considerations

All existing commands are stored in a hashset. Newly created shorthands are stored in a hashmap. 
Upon executing a new command, the parser looks up the command word in the existing commands hashset first.
If the command word does not exist within the hashset, the parser then looks up the command word in the shorthands hashmap.

The shorthand allows each original command to have up to one and only one shorthand.
This is to prevent ambiguity when the user enters a shorthand that is used by multiple original commands, 
as well as confusion when an original command could have multiple shorthands.

#### Clearing App Data

##### Overview

The `clear` command allows users to clear all data stored in the app.
This includes all persons and transactions in the `spendnsplitbook.json` file,
as well as all shorthands in the `preferences.json` file.

This command is irreversible, and should be used with caution. This command is introduced for new users to be able to quickly
clear the sample data and start using the app with their own data. 
Should the user ever wish to clear the data and start afresh again in the future, they can also use this command.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component and `Model` component:

<img src="images/ClearCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="550"/>

##### Feature Details

1. The user specifies the `clear` command.
2. The app clears all data from its Storage, and displays empty person and transaction lists.

#### Accessing Help

##### Overview

The `help` command brings up the help window, which contains a URL link to the online user guide.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Ui`, `Logic` and `Model` component:

<img src="images/HelpCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="550"/>

##### Feature Details

1. The user specifies the `help` command.
2. The app opens the help window and centers it on the screen.

#### Exiting the App

##### Overview

The `exit` command exits the app. This closes the app window (including the help window if opened) and terminates the app.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Ui`, `Logic` and `Model` component:

<img src="images/ExitCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="550"/>

##### Feature Details

1. The user specifies the `exit` command.
2. The app closes the app window and terminates the app.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

### Stronger List Command Input Validation

- **Background**: Currently, the `Name` of our `Person` is currently validated.
For example, it cannot contain symbols and cannot begin with a whitespace.
However, the `listPerson` validation on input arguments is insufficient.

- **Issue**: Executing `listPerson $$$` shows "0 person(s) listed" with no error.
This is not the right behaviour as `$$$` will never be included in a `Name`, and an
error message should be shown instead.

- **Enhancement**: We plan on ensuring `listPerson` performs stronger validation on
its input, invalidating any arguments cannot exist in a `Name`. For instance, each
command argument in `listPerson` should be validated to be alphanumeric. Similarly,
`listTransaction` should also validate the arguments in a similar fashion. Should
the input arguments fail validation, we plan to show an error message as shown below.

Sample Execution:
```
$ listPerson $$$

Names in should only contain alphanumeric characters
Example: listPerson Alex David
```

### Improved Space Sensitivity in Names

- **Background**: Currently, the `Name` of our `Person` is currently able to trim
leading and trailing spaces, allowing us to treat `Alex Yeoh` and `&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex Yeoh&nbsp;&nbsp;`
as the same `Name`. However, the `Name` is sensitive to spaces in between. This results
in `Alex Yeoh` and `Alex&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeoh` being treated as different names.

- **Issue**: Suppose a `Person` named `Alex Yeoh` exists in our application
  (and no one is named `Alex&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeoh` with the additional spaces in between).
Executing `addTransaction d= n=Alex&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeoh ...` will show an error of
"This transaction involves unknown parties; please set them to 'Others'" even if all
other names correctly refer to people in the application. This is not the right behaviour
as our application should be able to detect that `Alex Yeoh` and `Alex&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeoh`
are equivalent.

- **Enhancement**: We plan on ensuring that our application collapses multiple spaces
between individual names such that names like `Alex Yeoh` and `Alex&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeoh`
can be considered to refer to the same `Name`.

### Enhanced Timestamp Validation Messages
- **Background**: Many of the transaction-related commands, such as `addTransaction` and `editTransaction`
may involve a `Timestamp` input. Currently, we validate our `Timestamp` through a combination of regex
and checking of `DateTimeParseException` from `LocalDateTime.parse(datetime)`. Currently, if
any validation fails, we show the following error message.

> Date must be in DD/MM/YYYY format and time must be in HH:MM format; date should
come before time with a single space separating them if both are provided

- **Issue**: This error message is too general, and does not effectively communicate
to the user why the date is invalid, making it difficult for the user to correct
the `Timestamp` input in the transaction-related commands.

- **Enhancement**: We plan to make our `Timestamp` validation error messages
more specific in order to let the user know how they can correct their input. Specifically,
we plan on covering these 5 cases:
1. Incorrect Date Format
2. Incorrect Time Format
3. Incorrect Date and Time Format (e.g. `25/06/2023 + 11:30` didn't separate the date and time
with a single space)
4. Invalid Date (e.g. `32/13/2023` has an invalid day and month)
5. Invalid Time (e.g. `25/06/2023 25:61` has an invalid time)

If there are multiple issues in the input, the error message will be prioritised based
on the order above.

Below are examples of the enhanced error messages in commands with `Timestamp` input.
The `Timestamp` input comes after `ts=` in the `addTransaction` command.

Example 1: Incorrect Date Format
```
$ addTransaction d=Bread n=John c=10 ts=abcd n=Self w=1

Date must be in DD/MM/YYYY format with leading zeroes in the date, month and year,
and forward slashes as separators (e.g. 25/06/2020).
Example: addTransaction d=Bread n=John c=10 ts=25/06/2020 n=Self w=1
```

Example 2: Incorrect Time Format
```
$ addTransaction d=Bread n=John c=10 ts=25/06/2023 abcd n=Self w=1

Time must be in HH:MM format with leading zeroes in the hours and minutes,
and a colon separating the hours and minutes (e.g. 09:05).
Example: addTransaction d=Bread n=John c=10 ts=25/06/2020 09:05 n=Self w=1
```

Example 3: Incorrect Date and Time Format
```
$ addTransaction d=Bread n=John c=10 ts=25/06/2023 + 11:30 n=Self w=1

The date and time must be in the format 'DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM' with a single space
between the date and time (e.g. 25/06/2020 09:05).
Example: addTransaction d=Bread n=John c=10 ts=25/06/2020 09:05 n=Self w=1
```

Example 4: Invalid Date
```
$ addTransaction d=Bread n=John c=10 ts=32/13/2023 n=Self w=1

The date entered does not exist. Please use a valid date in DD/MM/YYYY format.
Example: addTransaction d=Bread n=John c=10 ts=25/06/2020 n=Self w=1
```

Example 5: Invalid Time
```
$ addTransaction d=Bread n=John c=10 ts=25/06/2023 25:61 n=Self w=1

The time you entered does not exist. Please use a valid time in HH:MM format between
00:00 to 23:59.
Example: addTransaction d=Bread n=John c=10 ts=25/06/2020 09:05 n=Self w=1
```
