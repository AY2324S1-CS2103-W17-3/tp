Portion refers to the amount of money that a person owes you for a transaction. \
The portion is calculated based on the cost of the transaction and the proportion of the transaction that the person has

### Sorting people by balance: `sortBalance`

Sorts the list of people in your address book based on their outstanding balances in either ascending or descending
order. This allows you to quickly identify who owes the most or the least amount of money. Negative balance means you

Format: `sortBalance o=ORDER`

Parameters:

- `o=ORDER`: Specifies the order in which to sort the balances. Use `asc` for ascending order and `desc` for
  descending order. Raise error for missing or unknown parameters.

Examples:

* `sortBalance o=asc`
    * This command will rearrange the list to show the person with the lowest outstanding balance at the top, followed
      by others in increasing order of their outstanding balances.
* `sortBalance o=desc`
    * This command will rearrange the list to show the person with the highest outstanding balance at the top,
      followed by others in decreasing order of their outstanding balances.

Sample execution:

```
$ sortBalance o=asc
All contacts balance in ascending order. Negative balance means you own them money.
1. Alex Yeoh, -$15
2. Bernice Yu, -$12
3. Charlotte Oliveiro, $23
```

![sortBalance success](images/user-guide/sortBalance1.png)

```
$ sortBalance
Invalid sorting order, must be `o=asc` or `o=desc`

$ sortBalance o=increasing
Invalid sorting order, must be `o=asc` or `o=desc`
```

![sortBalance error](images/user-guide/sortBalance2.png)

### Creating shared transactions: `createGroupTransaction`

Creates a transaction for multiple people with customised split ratios.

Format: `createGroupTransaction c=COST d=DETAILS [n=NAME w=WEIGHT]...`

- Cost has to be a number.
- Positive cost means that the person owes you.
- Negative cost means that you owe the person.
- If you want to create a weight for yourself, include `n=Self` to refer to yourself.
- At least one pair of name and weight must be provided.
- Weight must be an integer.
- The cost for each person is calculated as follows:
    - Individual cost = Total Cost * (Individual Weight / Total Weight)

Examples:

* `createGroupTransaction c=100 d=Dinner n=John w=2 n=Mary w=2 n=Alice w=1`
    * creates 3 transactions: two transactions of $40 for John and Mary (2/5 of $100 each), and one transaction of $20
      for
      Alice (1/5 of $100)
* `createGroupTransaction c=600 d=Rent n=Self w=1 n=John w=1 n=Mary =w1`
    * creates 2 transactions: $200 each for John and Mary (since you incurred 1/3 of the cost, which is $200)

Sample execution:

```
$ createGroupTransaction c=100 d=Dinner n=John w=2 n=Mary w=2 n=Alice w=1

Successfully created 3 transactions totalling $100:    
    John owes you $40
    Mary owes you $40
    Alice owes you $20
```

![createGroupTransaction success](images/user-guide/createGroupExpense1.png)

```
$ createGroupTransaction c=200 d=Textbooks

Error: At least one other person must be included in a shared transaction.

For example,
c=30 d=Lunch n=John w=1 n=Mary w=1
```

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need

are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

## FAQ

### Why do the portions in the log not add up exactly to the balance?

The portions displayed are rounded to a fixed number of decimal places. This means there may be fractional differences
between the actual portions and what is displayed.

Example:

```
If these are the logs stored:
A:      0.122
B:      0.223
Total:  0.345

This is displayed instead when the app is set to show 2 decimal places:
A:      0.12
B:      0.22
Total:  0.35
```
